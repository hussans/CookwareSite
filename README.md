**Description**: Given a prototype of a website, make a accurate look alike which is responsive in mobile, tablet, and desktop. Use bootstrap, flex, and grid in one section of the website without using the other. So if you use grid, you can't use bootstrap and flex. Also create your own cards. No bootstrap cards allowed.

**Peer**: Nolan Parker, the laptop page is overall pretty good except the header is not centered and the space between the footer and the bottom row is a bit larger.  The Email address is also the wrong font.  Spacing on the sides are messed up for the tablet size along with the cards, they do not respond to the responsiveness.  the footer looks good for tablet.    Mobile also does not have responsiveness.  Overall good job everything lines up pretty good.
